<!-- Jordan Trimble
    My dad, my brother, and the pigs.

    Sitting on a bench under a tree with my dad and brother. 

    Waiting for something I can't remember. My brother and I, dying of boredom and curiosity. 

    When we were young, my parents never let us on the internet or any device that had access to that world. We wanted to do one thing and one thing only. Watch youtube.

    After multiple minutes of begging and pleading and whining, my dad caves and opens the app. He opens the search bar and types in a video title.

    The three of us sit on that bench under that tree watching the three little pigs.  twice.
