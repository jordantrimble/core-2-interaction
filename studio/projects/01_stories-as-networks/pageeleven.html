    <p style="text-align: center;">I will tell you what I miss: I miss watching a movie and at the end, huge scrolled words come on the screen and say: </p>
        
    <p style="text-align: center;" class="p2">The End.</p>
    
    <p style="text-align: center;">I miss finishing a novel and there on the last page, at a discrete distance from the last words of the last sentence, are the dark letters spelling</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;" class="p2">The End.</p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">It was its own thrill. I didnâ€™t ignore them, I read them, even if only silently, with a deep sense of feeling: both the feeling of being replete, a feeling of satisfaction, and the feeling of loss, the sadness of having finished the <a href="pagetwelve.html" style="text-decoration: none;">book.</a></p>
