    <p class="p1">And in the best of all possible lives, that beginning and that end are the same:</p>

    <p>in poem after poem I encountered words that mark the first something made out of language that we hear as children repeated night after night, like a refrain:</p>

    <p>I love you.</p>

    <p>I am here with you.</p>

    <p>Don’t be afraid.</p>

    <p>Go to sleep now.</p>

    <p>And I encountered words that mark the last something made out of language that we hope to hear on earth:</p>

    <p>I love you.</p>

    <p> I am here with you.</p>

    <p>Don’t be afraid.</p>

    <p>Go to sleep <a href="pageseventeen.html" style="text-decoration: none;">now.</a></p>
