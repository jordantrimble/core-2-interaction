    <p>I have never,</p>
    <p>in my life,</p>
    <p>read a poem that ended with the words</p>
    <p>The End.</p>
    <p>Why is that, I wonder.</p>
    <p>I think perhaps the brevity of poems compared to novels makes one feel that there has been no great sustention of energy,</p>
    <p>no marathon worthy of pulling tape across the finish line.</p>
    <p>And then I found a poem of mine that I had carefully written by hand in the sixth grade,</p>
    <p>and at the bottom of the page,</p>
    <p>in India ink,</p>
    <p> beautifully apart from the rest of the text,</p>
    <p>were the words</p>
    <p>The End.</p>
    <p>And I realized children very often denote the end because it is indeed a great achievement for them to have written anything,</p>
    <p>and they are completely unaware of the number of stories and poems that have already been written;</p>
    <p>they know some,</p>
    <p>of course,</p>
    <p>but have not yet found out the extent to which they are not the only persons residing on the planet.</p>
    <p>And so they sign their poems and stories like kings.</p>
    <p>Which is a wonderful <a href="pagefourteen.html" style="text-decoration: none;">thing.</a></p>
