    <p>I was at the UC with a couple of my friends having a study session. One of my friends wanted coffee and I agreed to go with her across the street to get some. We got to the crosswalk and there was this dog patiently waiting with his owner. The dog spotted us and turned around to sit down and looked directly at me. This dog kept eye contact with the me until the light turned green. We weren't sure why the dog had such an interest in me, he only looked away a to catch a glimpse of my friend a couple times. My friend said the dog must have really liked me but I couldn't help but think maybe something was on my face.
