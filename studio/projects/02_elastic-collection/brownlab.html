    <p>I went to Blank Street Coffee to get a chai latte and soon after I arrived, this dog and her owner did as well. She was very polite and sat patiently waiting to leave. She only stood up a few times to try and say hi to the other people in the cafe but her owner kept her sitting for the majority of the time. Her tail was wagging extremely fast and when I was leaving I had to very carefully step over her tail without stepping on it.</p>
