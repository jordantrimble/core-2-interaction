    <p>When I moved into my new dorm my brother and I were exploring the area. This cat was laying outside a flower shop and my brother and I stopped to say hi. We both gave her a little scratch on her head and while my brother was petting her, she swatted at his hand. It was a playful swat but that didn't stop my brother from jumping up and yelping. Very over dramatic.</p>
