    <p>One day as I was walking to class I noticed a pigeon laying on its side. Birds don't typically do that and I assumed it was dead. I got really nervous and feared it really was dead. However, as I approached the bird stood up, ruffled his feathers, and dozed off again. He was taking a nap.</p>
