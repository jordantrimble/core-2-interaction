    <p>My friend asked me to go to petco with her to pick out a toy for her friend's dog. Petco has been a pretty common location in my own life. I got my first betta fish there, I named him bluey… because he was blue. And once we got a dog we went there quite a bit for the necessities. However the main reason I loved petco as a kid was because i was able to look at all the rodents and reptiles. This trip made me realize how the little kid in me is still very strong because I was distracted the entire time by this chameleon. He strutted right up to the glass and put on a show. I would've bought it but I don't wouldn't be able to bring it back home. I don't think chameleons do well on planes. Plus, my dad would faint at the thought of his 20 year old daughter buying a chameleon because he “did a lil dance”.</p>
