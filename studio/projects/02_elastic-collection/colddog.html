    <p>I was on my way to work one morning and was standing at a crosswalk. It was raining and miserable out and I looked down to see these two giant brown eyes staring at me. This poor little corgi looked like he would rather be doing anything than walking in the rain. We were both upset. He was upset about being in the rain and I was upset about going to work. At least he was able to rock the hot pink raincoat.</p>
