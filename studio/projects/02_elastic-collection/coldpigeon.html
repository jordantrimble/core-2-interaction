    <p>I was walking home from class one night and as I was walking down the road I saw a pigeon fluffing up his feathers as much as possible. It was extremely cold that night and I felt really bad for this lil dude. If I could have made him a pigeon sized blanket I would have but not only do I lack the ability to successfully sew or knit anything, my fingers were about to freeze off.</p>
