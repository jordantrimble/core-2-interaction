        One fall day I decided to walk through central park. I walked through the entire park and saw these two swimming in circles with each other. I stopped for a bit to watch. It was like they were playing. All of a sudden one of them plunged its head into the water. After about a minute it came up for air and looked to its friend. The two of them promptly started swimming in circles again. I would've loved to know what was going through their heads.</p>
