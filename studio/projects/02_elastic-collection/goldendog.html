    <p>Every Friday I stop by Blank Street Coffee to get an iced chai latte before class. I walked in and saw the most beautiful golden. Not only was he adorable but he was extremely friendly. He walked to a man and greeted him by sniffing his knee and waiting for pets and then he strutted over to me and did the same. After greeting the two of us he returned to his owner and sat by her feet waiting for coffee. This floof made the 9:00 am class worth it.</p>
