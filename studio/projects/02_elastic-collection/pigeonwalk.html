    <p>I was at Washington Square Park with a friend for an assignment. We saw a guy who had trained the pigeons and was instructing them to fly in circles above him. He had a jaw that asked for a dollar to have pigeons placed on your arms. My friend and I watched this girl have about ten pigeons land on her arm. My friend was in complete awe but I was distracted by this little guy. He was on the move. He looked like he had things to do, places to be, other pigeons to see.</p>
