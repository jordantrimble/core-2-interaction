    <p>I went to St. George Coffee for the first time a few weeks ago. While I was there, three women came in with a puppy. He did his best to sit quietly and wait but being a puppy, he was full of energy and curiosity. He kept trying to explore and when he was pulled back he would howl as if his owner committed a great crime against him. He got his way eventually as the left and he was free to explore again, while on his leash</p>
