    <p>Last year when I was living in 301 I would sometimes stop by CVS to get a snack for later. That night I went with Tostitos. Usually when I walk back to my dorm at night I keep my eyes out for rats, this night i was stuck in my own little world, none the wiser to what was about to happen. I was passing a tree bed and shook the bag of chips without realizing it. All of a sudden a rat jumped out from behind the tree and ran at my feet. I shrieked and took off towards the dorm building.</p>
