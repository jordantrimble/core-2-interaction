        One day I was walking by Union Square park when I noticed an old man feeding the squirrels. He caught me watching and offered to teach me how. You hold the very end of the peanut and tap it on a hard surface. The squirrels will hear the rattle of the nut and come over to carefully take it from your fingers. I had a long conversation with this man as we fed the squirrels. It wasn't until he gave me the bag of peanuts and went on his way that I noticed the flask loosely concealed by a brown paper bag. Pretty sure he was a bit drunk.
