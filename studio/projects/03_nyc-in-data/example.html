        <h1>REMEMBERING EARTH TIME</h1>

            <div class="wordColumn" style="text-align: left;">
                In the face of our ecological unraveling, time as we know it is rupturing. Around the world, buds bloom
                too early, winters don’t quite arrive, and time bends as long-buried carbons emerge to haunt the future.
                As we increasingly run out of time, accelerating towards climate catastrophe, how can we free ourselves
                from the clutch of the minute hand and embrace the possibilities inherent in every moment?
            </div>

            <div class="wordColumn" style="text-align: left;">
                This April, join us in the ancient and mysterious region of Dartmoor, in Devon, England for a four-day
                retreat led by Sufi teacher and Emergence’s founder and executive editor Emmanuel Vaughan-Lee that will
                consider how we can attune to a sense of time rooted in the living world.
            </div>

            <div class="wordColumn" style="text-align: left;">
                Expanding upon Emergence’s forthcoming print edition, Vol 5: TIME, this gathering will open participants
                to move beyond the time-bound consciousness of control, separation, and linearity we have created, and
                towards a different kind of time in which we are attentive to our present moment of ecological crisis
                and transformation. Through talks, writing workshops, storytelling, meditation, and nature connection
                practices, we will remember the cycles and rhythms of the Earth.
